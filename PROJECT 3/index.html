<!-- -A user has three tries to guess the number, between 1-100, that the computer picked.
-Whenever they guess, let them know if their guess is too high, or too low.
-After their third guess, reveal the number the computer chose to them, and let them know if they got it right or wrong.
-Use an HTML form to create an input input field for the user to enter their guess
-Add a "Submit" button to the form, and use the "onsubmit" attribute to call your JavaScript function.

Summary

Create a an input field to accept the guessing number. Create a button for submit, includes the onclick attributes. Now
everytime we click on the button to guess the number, the guess number function will execute. 
Create 3 p tags w/ id Which will display the message for each command-->
